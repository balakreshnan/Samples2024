# o1 - Root cause analysis for manufacturing - Plant Factory line

## Introduction

- Root cause analysis for manufacturing
- using o1 reasoning to understand the root cause
- create a ISO 9001:2015 report
- understanding recommendation at phD level output

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Azure open ai resource
- Sign up for o1 access
- Test in UI for now
- All data set created are fictional
- simulated data set for plant factory line

## Steps

- Process is to understand how we can use o1 reasoning to understand the root cause
- i created 3 data sets for this purpose
- first is for meta data about the line and equipments and components
- Second is the alarms and event data MES sends out from various HMI and PLC, Sensors
- Third is the historical data of the line collected in historians
- Next create a prompt with data for analysis

### Prompt

- Create a prompt with data

```
I am providing 3 datasets one for meta data, one for alarms and event, one for historical data with sensor. Your job is to analyze the latest fault and find the root cause from which equipment and subsystem it originated.

Here is the meta data:
