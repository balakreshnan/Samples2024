# Create documentation video using AI

## Introduction

- Manual process to create video documentation
- Leveraging GPT 4 vision to understand the image and create content
- Once we have the content we use Text to Speech Avatar service to create video content
- Once we select persona and voice we can create video content
- Once video is created download as mp4 and use it any system
- For now there only one persona available to use in text to speect avatar service.

## Steps

- First get sample images with screenshot of the process of the application
- I usually do a flow chart end to end process of the application and use that to create documentation
- Then we log into Azure Open AI Studio where gpt 4 vision is available
- Upload the image and prompt prompts (Customize) to create step by step content from image
- Copy the text that is created and edit if needed
- If the text is not good rephrase the prompt and try again
- Once the text is good copy the text and go to text to speech avatar service
- Paste the text and select persona and voice
- Once the video is created download the video and use it in any system
