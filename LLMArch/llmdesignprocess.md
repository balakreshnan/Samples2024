# Generation AI Applicaiton Development Process

## Introduction

- Process to describe how to develop AI application using Generation AI models and data
- Idea here is what would be the process to use to develop Generation AI application
- Given the data is unstructured like docs, pdf, images, videos, audio, etc
- Could have multiple steps or process involved in the application
- Each step can have it's own process in the design phase
- Each step can have their own data sources, industry expertise, etc
- while we build we have to keep human in the loop to make sure the application is working as expected
- Also steps are dependant on use case, it might 1 or more depending on the use case
- the below is high level guidance on how to design the application
- It's not technical design, rather it's more of a process design

## Design Process

- First based on the use case, identify the steps needed to build the application
- Entire application might have multiple use cases
- Use case is defined as single business process to solve
- Can be persona based or be generic also. Example: HR, Finance, BPO, etc
- In each step we first identify the data sources needed and source the data
- Next will be to understand from industry perspective what are the steps needed to build the application
- Example: if it's a chatbot, then we need to understand the business process
- Example: we need to understand where the industry specific documents are there.
- Usually documents are all in one place and entire set might not be good for our use case
- So we need to understand what are the documents needed for our use case
- Next is find the Process and people who will use the application and understand the process
- Also the people who will develop the appliction
- Next check and see if there is other data sources needed to build the application
- Example: tablular dataset, external sources like weather, public data, etc
- We also need Technical experts, business experts to help us build the application
- They add lots of value in making sure application is purpose built.
