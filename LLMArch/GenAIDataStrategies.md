# Gen AI Data Strategies

## Introduction

- As the Large Language Model (LLM) models are getting more powerful, and the content is uses are mostly text, videos, images, audio, and other forms of data.
- The data strategies are key to the success of the model.
- How can we create a startegies to manage the data for the RAG type application
- How can we create data strategies for fine tuning or training large language models
- Most data are unstructured
- There are new techniques to create embeddings for the data
- How do we manage security and life cycle management across the data
- How to enforce data governance and compliance across global standards and regulations
- How do provide safe, privacy and secured data for the models
- How to manage data quality.
- How can we create lineages on usage of data and how it's consumed
- As the technology progress, startegy will also evolve over time.
- I am keeping it high level, as the details will be based on the use case and the data and systems used.
