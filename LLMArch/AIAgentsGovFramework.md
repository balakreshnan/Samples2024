## AI Agents Center of Excellence - Explained

- Framework capacbility needed to enable AI agents based application development
- Start with Use case management and prioritization
- Get the application lifecycle management in place ( i won't cover to deep as this will be part of Software development lifecycle)
- Most agent applications might have multiple agents so we need router management to manage all the routers across applications
- AI Agentic applications need a meta data management to know data sources, agents and routers used in per applications
- Application specific data sources and agent per data source management
- Agents can be code agent or Strategic planning agents, so we need to manage the agents and their lifecycle
- Agents prompts can also be stored in meta data management

- AI Agents can store information needed execution and also use memory to share information across agents
- Memeory can also be used for agent to agent to communication
- Cost management and monitoring of agents
- Performance management of agents by monitoring latency, throughput and error rates and other metrics
- Responsible ai management to ensure the agents are not biased and are ethical
- Entire applications are monitoring AI Ops.
- Data and AI governance to ensure data is tagged and dictionary is maintained
- Data can be categorized as PII, PHI, PCI, etc
- Data ownership and data lineage to ensure data is not misused
